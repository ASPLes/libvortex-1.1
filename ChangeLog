	turbulence: * [fix] Applied several printf-format fixings.

	* [fix] Several updates to fix various debug log calls with   wrong or poorly configured arguments.

	turbulence: * [fix] Updated test_01.c to create a socket by other means to avoid   using socket creation API at Vortex which is creating some interactions   with the reg test.

2013-04-10  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	turbulence: * [fix] Updated turbulence engine to avoid failing when it is not   possible to setup set hard and soft socket limit.
	* [fix] Updated turbulence profile path engine to defer profile
	  path decision when separate="yes", it is on-connect selection,
	  serverName on profile path is ".*" and the user didn't still provided
	  a serverName (because no BEEP session has been stablished yet). This
	  fixes those situations where a profile path with a serverName=".*"
	  catches all connections even though having other profile paths with
	  the right serverName (matching one). Added test_27 reg test to reproduce
	  the bug and check the fix introduced.

	turbulence: * [fix] Added additional regression test to check connections that must   be sent to child process but at <on connect> time: test_27. Still more   work required.

2013-04-09  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	turbulence: * [fix] Making child process wait at the parent process to be skipped   when detected parent process is finishing..

	turbulence: * [fix] Updated child local socket path code run by parent process   to avoid calling to connect when the path doesn't exists...implemented   internal micro-waits to let the child to process until the parent is   able to connect.

	turbulence: * [fix] Updated mod-websocket to allow importing certificates as defined   inside mod-tls.conf so they can be easily unified into a single place.

2013-04-05  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	* [fix] Completed error handling inside vortex_listener for port-share   feature.

	* [fix] Completed working and tested implementation for Websocket   port sharing including support to run on the same port BEEP,   BEEP over WebSocket and BEEP over TLS websocket..

	* [fix] More cleanups on port share code. Updated code to release   pending code at the listener side. Updated test_20 to ensure the   connection is really working..

	* [fix] More updates on port sharing code used by web-socket extension library.   Now regtest (test-20) finishes properly. Still more work required.

2013-04-04  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	* [new] Added initial support for port share support that will allow   running BEEP and BEEP over WebSocket (with TLS varation) on the same   port without having to have especial configurations from library   users. API added:

	* [fix] Several modifications to make proxy on parent engine to properly
	  release references when connection close found without having wrong
	  reference accesses.

2013-04-03  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	* [fix] Added new regression test to check if it is possible to flood   a vortex BEEP listener by sending a greetings initial message formed   by infinite frames with more flag on.

	* [fix] Fixed some debug logs that should be critical at vortex
	  connection module.

2013-04-01  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	turbulence: * [new] Global engine update to allow supporting in a general   manner proxing BEEP connection on the master process so they   are handled transparently at the child process as if it were   received directly by them.
	  This new support has been added to bypass the limitations of
	  OpenSSL in terms to saving SSL context and recovering it at a
	  child process.

	  With this new support mod-websocket is able to work on master
	  and child processes (using reuse=yes configuration).
	  NICE!!! Still more work is required to update regression
	  tests and cleanup the code.

	  API added:
	  - turbulence_conn_mgr_proxy_on_parent

	* [new] Updated turbulence code to install a vortex log handler

2013-03-31  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	turbulence: * [new] Added initial working mod-webosocket version with support to handle   applications at the parent process. Still more work is required to allow   applications on children too. Now it is possible to reach applications served   by Turbulence via BEEP over WebSocket (ws:// and wss://). Nice!!   Updated regression test to include an initial test suite (test_25).
	* [fix] Making turbulence process to not activate SIGCHLD handler on master
	  process until a child is created.

	* [new] Updated Turbulence engine to allow configuring search domains (for
	  data applications) inside <system-paths> nodes as done until now inside
	  profile path declaration.

2013-03-31  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	libaxl: * [fix] Fix axl_node_get_content_trim to flag its result with   const char * (instead of just char *).

	* [fix] Making channel start notification to detect and fix serverName   value provided by the requestor in the case serverName value was already   configured on the BEEP session by a previous request.
	* [fix] Updated vortex-websocket extension library to setup the serverName
	  value associated to the BEEP session according to the Host header received
	  over the WebSocket connection (if provided). Also updated the module to
	  flag the connection as "having TLS on" when received a successful
	  TLS WebSocket connection (wss://). This way turbulence is able to handle
	  BEEP sessions with TLS profile and BEEP session over wss:// with the same
	  profile path declaration. Fixed vortex-websocket-1.1.pc to also require
	  nopoll module.

2013-03-24  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	turbulence: * [fix] Added initial code to support mod-websocket (a module to provide   websocket services through libvortex-websocket-1.1).

	turbulence: * [fix] Fixed documentation failure which was causing to get the exarg mainpage   instead of turbulence's. Added security clarification note to explain why it is   not required to add any connmark declaration when it comes to secure profiles   inside.

	turbulence: * [fix] Updated mod-tls to close the connection when TLS handshake fails   to avoid security implementations (even though they are covered). Now if   the user configures a close-on-failure="yes" or doesn't say anything about   that attribute, the connection will be closed.

2013-03-23  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	turbulence: * [fix] Added new regression test to try to trick turbulence server   when requesting TLS (but it wasn't properly initiated).

	  calls are required. API added:

	  - vortex_connection_get_hook
	  - vortex_connection_set_hook

	* [fix] Updated reading code to track the number of "no data available" operations
	  found for a particular connection to shutdown it when a certain amount is
	  reached.

2012-05-28  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	* [fix] Updated vortex sequencer sending code to first manage   channel 0 requests and then process the rest of connections. This is   done to ensure administrative channel is able to communicate channel   creation or removal before next request happens on those channels.   Until now, under some rare cases vortex was producing a protocol   violation because it was sending content before the remote peer   received the channel open RPY over the channel 0.
	* [fix] Updated vortex_async_queue_ref to return a boolean value
	  to signal the caller if reference operation finished properly.

	* [fix] Updated vortex thread pool activation to acquire a queue
	  reference directly from the activation object instead of getting
	  that reference from the pool. Fixes test-00e

	  code to check the thread add period to be bigger or
	  equal to (not just bigger) so threads are added when
	  the period is filled (not just filled + 1seg).

Also updated the   tool to detect if SASL is enabled (as declared inside radmin.conf)   so the tool directly start SASL before proceeding creating radmin-ctl   channel.
	* [new] Added new script that properly setup the radmin module, creating
	  all files and user databases. Script added:

	  - tbc-setup-mod-radmin.py

	turbulence: * [fix] Making python tests to be executed only if requested by   the tester. This is to avoid python poor support to init and   finalize several times the engine.

	turbulence: * [new] Updated turbulence module API to include a function that   allows configuring if a particular module should be unmapped when close.   Used this to avoid unmapping mod-python, which later gives problems if   it is loaded again into the same process. Updated regresssion test to   use this. API added:
	   - turbulence_module_skip_unmap

2012-01-24  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

2012-01-24  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	* [new] General engine update to provide an API for sending MSG,   RPY and ERR messages whose frames are all flagged with more flag   on. This allows to send a set of messages, that are then translated   into frames, where all of them belongs to the same MSG. API added:
	   - vortex_channel_send_msg_more
	   - vortex_channel_send_rpy_more
	   - vortex_channel_send_err_more

	  Added regression test (test_02-r) to reproduce use cases and check
	  that it is working. Added documentation explaining how to use this.


	* [new] Updated PyVortex API to provide an API to new opened send
	  operations (send_msg_more). API added:

	   - vortex.Channel.send_msg_more
	   - vortex.Channel.send_rpy_more
	   - vortex.Channel.send_err_more

	  Updated documentation.

	* [fix] Fixed BEEP checking engine for received frames to ensure it is
	  detected when a remote BEEP peer replies two times to a MSG frame whose
	  msgno is 0. Bug found during send_msg_more API development.

	* [fix] Fixed sending operations involving VortexPayloadFeeder objects that
	  were paused to check if their msgno is on the pending reply list to avoid
	  a race where pause operation happens at the same time the msgno is removed
	  from the list.

	* [fix] Fixed security bug where vortex engine may accept a fake RPY with
	  message number of 0, deliverying to user configured handler, even without
	  having sent a MSG frame with that number. Only happened with msgno 0.

2012-01-20  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	* [fix] Several updates into the core library to better log   errors that involves closing the connection. Now those errors   are logged into connection so they can be checked using already   available channel pop error API. Added new connection error   to identify connection closed by remote peer without going through   the BEEP close process.

	turbulence: * [fix] Making turbulence conn mgr to log errors found on   connections that are closed. Skipped typical errors to   avoid logging frequent errors (like connection closed by   remote peer, and similar).

	turbulence: * [new] Updated turbulence context handler to record a reference   to the context itself into the vortex context. Also added new macro   to get VortexCtx from TurbulenceCtx. API added:
	   - VORTEX_TBC_CTX

	jsVortex: * [fix] Fixed bug while splitting frames what uses   utf-8 codes that expands into 2 or 3 bytes when translated   to byte representation, causing not observing max allowed   bytes accepted by remote BEEP peer. Now the situation is   detected and the difference is removed so splitted piece   fits into the accepted window size. Added regression test   to reproduce the bug and check fix introduced.

2011-12-21  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	* [fix] Fixed API clash between debian/ubuntu and RHEL where SSL_CTX_new   and method created returns and receives const SSL_METHOD *. Updated the   code to avoid declaring variables with that type passing directly the   value returned from method creation into SSL_CTX_new. Bug reported by   Philip Black-Knight..

	* [fix] Phil Black-Knight reported and fixed a problem at   vortex_connection_set_profile_mask where the function was   always returning an error code for the first handler installed   (although it was indeed properly installed).
	* [fix] Removed code that checks for reference counting at internal
	  channel termination when detected pending messages to be sent
	  (new design doesn't requires this).

	  built by vortex connection reference counting and python reference
	  counting. Added initial file.sup to better track all memory consumed
	  by PyVortex.

2011-12-13  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	  threads from the pool are blocked and to check that even in those
	  situations vortex_exit_ctx finishes right.
	  Also updated documentation...

2011-12-08  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	* [fix] Code cleanups at vortex channel module (removed internal variables   last_reply_delivered, last_msg_delivered, last_ans_delivered,   last_ans_seqno_delivered).

	* [fix] Removed old code used to drop messages for broken   connections (inside vortex sequencer) which is no longer   needed.

	* [fix] Complete vortex sequencer rewrite to allow handling   all outgoing sending jobs in a fair manner (treating them   in rounds, giving all channels the possibility to send   content without being starved by highly interactive transfers).   This rewrite will also open the possiblity to implement   channel sending priorities. All reg tests working!

2011-12-01  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	turbulence: * [fix] Releasing and reacquiring lock before calling to broadcast   msg inside turbulence conn mgr. This is to avoid dead locks caused   by filter function that may call again turbulence conn mgr API   (which is already locked).

Also updated resequence signal code to check first if there are already other   previous notification (to avoid filling the queue with notifications).
	* [fix] Updated vortex thread API to include a new function that allows doing
	  search operations over a queue looking it during the search. API added:

	    - vortex_async_queue_lookup

	* [fix] Added new regression test (test-03f) that exposes a   but at channel pool close when all channels are available.
	* [fix] Updated vortex sequencer internal reference checking
	  to use connection reference from channel instead of the connection
	  reference directly (channel reference is owned by the sequencer
	  and connection is not). Updated internal queue priority to acquire
	  a reference to the channel to avoid wrong dealloc when a connection
	  failure is found in the middle of a transfer.

	* [fix] Updated vortex-file-transfer-server.c to also register   a profile that echos all content received..

2011-11-02  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	  and start chanel handling to avoid passing as reference the python
	  vortex.Ctx that was used to install those handlers.

	* [fix] Updated PyVortex regression test to include a check to create
	  a channel with a frame received handler forcing the PyVortexChannel
	  reference to be garbaged to check then to receive frames over that
	  channel. Reg test (py test-10-e).

	* [fix] Several modifications to PyVortex to avoid reusing python   references which do not reduce consumption significantly and makes   the binding less maintainable.
	* [fix] Updated py channel frame received code to not store the
	  PyVortexChannel reference as a parameter to the frame received handler
	  to avoid a crash when the frame received is fired having the python
	  channel collected (but not its C representation).

2011-08-09  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	* [fix] Updated vortex_profiles_invoke_start to only use global start   handler (used by pull API) when it is found start handler and extended   start handler is not defined (which indicates a profile with a particular   handlers).

2011-08-09  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	* [fix] Moved vortex ctx cleanup code to be run at vortex_exit_ctx   to avoid circular references problems (calling that releases references   is not run until the last vortex_ctx_unref which will never happen).   Checked regression tests to ensure everything keeps working (especially   pull api).
	* [new] Added new function to allow uninstall ctx cleanup function
	  from vortex ctx API.

2011-08-07  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	turbulence: * [new] General engine update to allow creating a BEEP connection between parent   and childs created. This connection is generic (is a BEEP connection!) and at   this moment is being used by mod-radmin to implement turbulence management and   status notification. GREAT!
	  Added turbulence regression test to check connection creation and its status:
	  test_10-b.

	* [new] Added first fully working/checked mod-radmin and turbulence-ctl tool that
	  allows getting real-time state for a running turbulence process. For now, the
	  tandem supports:

	    - showing connections on master parent and all childs
	    - showing all childs
	    - getting turbulence process status
	    - killing childs and connections (on master and childs process: nice!!).

	* [fix] General engine work to ensure regression tests releases all parent memory
	  at child process to allow easy memory leak and proper memory access using valgrind.
	  Until know there where too many errors to make valgrind reports to be usable.
	  Fixed many bugs and memory wrong access (and some leaks ;-).

	* [new] Added new module to handle turbulence child process object (and related
	  elements). API added:

	  - turbulence_child_new
	  - turbulence_child_ref
	  - turbulence_child_unref

	* [fix] General update at the turbulence context module to acquire a reference to
	  the vortex ctx object associated and to release it at the very end. Updated API
	  to include a method that allows checking if the current turbulence context is
	  associated (or it is) a child. API added:

	   - turbulence_ctx_is_child

	* [fix] Updated turbulence finalization to do module cleanup at the very last step
	  to allow module code to be available until the end of the turbulence context.
	  Also updated the code to not release vortex context associated when it is detected
	  not enough references (which shows wrong module/turbulence engine programming) but
	  instead of breaking, drop an error log.

	* [fix] Several updates on turbulence conn mgr module to avoid using state object
	  and to start using TurbulenceCtx as a step before getting such object which is
	  more safe (fixes memory wrong access and some races showed by valgrind).

	* [fix] Updated mod-sasl to allow loading extension.modules file from "sasl" domain
	  context defined (vortex_support_domain_find_data_file). Also updated the module
	  to release mod_msyql_sasl dtd on close.

	* [fix] Making mod-python to detect if some python app was loaded at the parent
	  (causing the python engine to be initialized as well) to avoid starting on child process.
	  There is no way to make python to work after a fork without an execve operation.
	  Instead of breaking misteriously, making the module to refuse loading giving a
	  concrete error message.

	* [fix] Reorganized mod-python loading code to load site and sytem config files
	  before initializing python (to avoid problems at the childs).

2011-08-07  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	* [new] Updated vortex listener API to allow creating a BEEP listener   without registering the object created into the vortex reader. API added:
	   - vortex_listener_new_full2

	* [fix] Making vortex_sequencer_drop_connection_messages to also check
	  for connection exit status to avoid iterating over internal sequencer
	  structures releasing connection pending messages.

	* [fix] Updated channel added/removed notification, inside vortex connection
	  module, to release and re-acquire mutex before jumping into user handler. Added
	  code to get safe references to handlers that will be called to avoid races.

	* [fix] Updated vortex internal data tracking to also record bytes sent. Also
	  fixed missed tracking for bytes received at readline functions (BEEP header).

	* [new] Updated vortex connection API to include a method that allows removing
	  keys/valus installed with vortex_connection_set_data/data_full wihtout calling
	  registered destroy functions. API added:

	   - vortex_connection_delete_key_data

	* [new] Updated thread API to include a function that return current reference
	  counting state for a VortexAsyncQueue. API added:

	  - vortex_async_queue_ref_count

	* [fix] Updated channel wait reply code to detect connection close when the
	  synchrnous wait is started.

	* [new] Updated vortex API to include a function that allows checking if
	  current vortex context is finishing. API added:

	  - vortex_is_exiting

	* [new] Updated vortex Ctx API to include a function that allows getting
	  current reference counting state. Added internal check to avoid running
	  dealloc operation when ref count bellow or equal to 0 is detected. API
	  added:

	  - vortex_ctx_ref_count

	* [fix] Fixed vortex_hash_remove which was calling to remove twice. ???

	* [fix] Updated vortex listener on accepted handler to acquire references to
	  handlers about being executed before releasing lock.

	* [fix] Making vortex listener module to acquire a reference to the listener
	  that created the new connection so the function vortex_connection_get_listener
	  returns a valid reference.

	* [fix] Updated PyVortexCtx object to support an attribute that returns current
	  reference counting. API added:

	  - vortex.Ctx.ref_count

	* [fix] Updated PyVortexCtx module to stop firing vortex events into python user
	  code when it is detected vortex is finishing.

2011-08-07  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	libaxl: * [fix] Added convenient function alias called axl_list_foreach, that   wraps axl_list_lookup, allowing to write code that looks what is   done. Added documentation to explain its use. API added:
	   - axl_list_foreach

	* [fix] Making axl_hash_remove internals to decrease number of items the hash
	  has before calling key/value destroy so those functions gets updated
	  status.

	turbulence: * [fix] Fixed internal profile path bug which was causing due to races   to not activate the right profile path when they depend on having   a channel activated. In the case the race is activated, the notification   about the channel comes after this data is required and thus the   profile path isn't activated. Checked regression tests to ensure   they are working.
	* [new] Adding new support function to implement microsecond wait. API
	  added:

	   - turbulence_ctx_wait

	turbulence: * [fix] Fixed wrong handling at child process creation when a profile path   was selected (because it is too generic) and TLS was then activated on that   child process. Now the child process detects this situation and preconfigures   profile path that was previously selected.
	* [fix] Security: making child control connection with parent to remove
	  the file associated as soon as the connection is stablished.

	* [fix] Added internal check to prevent child process creating new child
	  processes due to connection created.

2011-04-20  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	* [fix] Wimpie Nortje recently discovered a possible race condition caused   at vortex_connection_new used in conjuntion with onconnected handler causing   the thread started to do the notification to access to connection option   object which may be out of the scope, causing release function to be activated   depending on memory stack status with variable wrong results. General code   update to make server name acquisition to be also governed from associated   VortexCtx object, releasing vortex_connection_new function from allocating   a variable on the function stack to signal this configuration.

2011-04-18  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	* [fix] Updated internal channel pool same session check to test
	  if ctx reference is defined to acquire it from the pool (avoids
	  nasty context undefined message).

	* [fix] Fixed channel pool race inside PyVortex when configured
	  on created channel pool handler which was causing to nullify
	  internal reference if the thread planner chooses to notify pool
	  and then complete caller code (ouch!!)

	* [fix] Making vortex connection internal close to avoid contacting
	  vortex sequencer to drop pending packages when a vortex context
	  exit is in place.

	* [fix] Making vortex_channel_new to acquire an internal reference to the
	  channel created to avoid races between this function and the on created
	  handler. Checked in test_16 alive reg test. Making also to acquire a
	  reference to the connection during the creation process.

	* [fix] Making vortex thread pool to acquire independent references to
	  func and user data pointers to allow releasing internal mutexes during
	  user code invocation. Making thread pool module to skip user code
	  invocation in a vortex exit is in place.

	* [fix] General updates to vortex alive module to decouple channel creation
	  from the alive check itself to avoid races that may cause the alive check
	  to monopolize (which was integrating channel creation) resources. Fixed
	  several wrong access. Many thanks to DEXTER which provided a patch that
	  fixed several bugs in the initial code (wrong reply using msg, wrong
	  outstanding messages check, missing user failure handler configuration).

2010-10-06  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	  found is defined to skip it.

	* [fix] Updated turbulence_conn_mgr module to temporaly unlock internal
	  mutex when each individual connection shutdown is called during the
	  cleanup process (avoid deadlocks with user code that calls to conn mgr
	  functions from inside connection close handlers, that are activated by
	  shutdown stuff).

	* [fix] Fixed turbulence.example.conf to allow regtest pass (test_06).

2010-09-28  daniel  <daniel@9996078b-26e8-0310-a12f-ea49881d8364>

Now all operations   are done against opened profiles on a connection (not channels) which   improve operations where 1000 channels may be opened but only 3 profiles   are running.
	* [fix] Updated turbulence profile path module to allow application layer
	  to install a profile alias that causes to check a certain attribute
	  on a connection instead of the profile itself. This is useful for
	  TLS profile because once it finishes, there is no TLS channel to check.
	  API added:

	   - turbulence_ppath_add_profile_attr_alias

	  paths.

	* [fix] Updated turbulence process module to check if exists the run time
	  directory used to create the child control socket. The module creates it
	  in the case it is not available.

	  connection. API added:

	   - turbulence_conn_mgr_profiles_stats

2010-08-09  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	* [new] Updated vortex_connection_set_channel_removed_handler and   vortex_connection_set_channel_added_handler to return an unique   reference to the installed handler which allows to remove it   later. API added:
	   - vortex_connection_remove_handler

	* [fix] Change added channel notification at server side to be
	  done before doing the RPY to avoid race conditions.

	* [fix] Fixed memory leak at vortex_support_add_domain_search_path_ref
	  which was causing to lost memory references in the case the path
	  was already added.

	  as a fatal error not finding TLS profile among the set announced
	  by server greetings.

	  in common insert/remove cycles (specially using same keys). Updated
	  regression tests to check function and how it saves space (test_02_04_1).
	  Initial results shows a total amount of bytes allocated of 20,300 that
	  now consumes 389 in a constant manner (assuming insert and removes
	  keeps the hash under the same set of items).

	   - vortex_channel_set_outstanding_limit
	   - vortex_channel_get_outstanding_messages

	  Added regression test (test_01-k) to check function introduced.

	* [new] Updated vortex thread pool API to include a function to remove

2010-01-27  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	* [fix] Rewritten channel serialize code to be seqno based   rather msgno and frame type. This solves some issues with   heavily loaded frame handlers that causes some NUL frames   (stored as -1) to be missed. Also fixed connection dealloc   failures when channel serialize is enabled and ANS/NUL frames   are received. Added reg test test_03c to reproduce the   problem and check fix introduced.

2010-01-26  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

This solves memory deallocation   issues especially when python code install references to modules that are   later unloaded but VortexCtx C reference is still working. This shows   problems when turbulence unloads mod-python but its structures still   reference to python objects stored..This is now solved binding/storing   python objects into vortex.Ctx via internal API:
	    - py_vortex_ctx_register
	    - py_vortex_ctx_reigster_get

	* [fix] Updated internal code to reuse as much as possible already created
	  references. Check regression test.
