<h3>XML-RPC over BEEP: Building fast, prototyping better</h3>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>In this article is explained how BEEP [1] and XML-RPC [2] over BEEP
could be mixed to create new application protocols, rather than just
reusing native features provided by BEEP, to quickly prototype application protocols.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>As you may know, BEEP allows to build new application protocols
really fast. This is because many details are already addressed by the
protocol, remaining what is usually called <i>"the useful part"</i>,
that is, roughly, the BEEP message semantics.</p>

<p>Even knowing this fact, if you take every application protocol
design, you'll find that most if its definitions are RPC based
exchanges: the <i>"client"</i> request some resource, the
<i>"server"</i> replies some data. </p> 

<p>Usually, while facing the question: how do I fulfil all the
application protocol requirement?, the fact is that you don't have too
many possibilities: </p>

<ol>
<li>Take an already existing protocol, an layer on it: HTTP, SMTP,
FTP, etc.</li> 

<li>Design your own application protocol, defining all the
details.</li> 

<li>Use a RPC framework, including those ones based on the <i>remote
object reference</i> concept. Some of them could be ONC RPC [3], CORBA
[4] or ICE [5].</li> 

<li>Use BEEP to define your own profile and message semantic.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Choosing a solution in terms of your work</h2>

<p>Solutions <b><i>1.</i></b> and <b><i>2.</i></b> aren't, in the most
cases, the best solution. First, because it involves many work, and
second, layering on top of protocols not designed for this purpose
creates many problems. See on designing application protocols [6].</p>

<p>A first impression, in terms of work, using a RPC framework is the
most convenient solution. This is because you only have to use
facilities provided by the framework. This facilities are defined in higher level terms
allowing to produce solutions quite fast, without paying too much
attention to details. </p>

<p>However, its main disadvantage is that your problem must be
adapted, and many times redefined, to be implemented on top of the RPC
framework. </p>

<p>In fact, you <i>"can't get outside the RPC platform selected"</i>,
that is, you must take it and accept it completely. This usually isn't
a good new because you are locked to a vendor specific platform. </p>

<h2>Layering on top of BEEP</h2>

<p>BEEP allows you to have many of the advantages provided by previous
solutions, but without its pitfalls. It is a building block protocol that
allows you to re-use really interesting features.</p>

<p>You can start your development by choosing protocol block pieces
already working and integrated into a single product.</p>

<ul>
  <li><p><i>If your application protocol requires peer authentication</i>: you
  simply use <a
  href="http://www.aspl.es/fact/files/af-arch/vortex/html/starting_to_program.html#vortex_manual_sasl_for_client_side"><i>SASL profiles</i></a>.</p>

  <p>If authentication its a part of the project to be implemented later,
  that's not a problem at all. You can concentrate all your efforts in
  the <i>"real work"</i> and then add to your application protocol
  authentication support without worrying you missed something.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p><i>If your application protocol requires session privacy</i>:
  you simply use <a
  href="http://www.aspl.es/fact/files/af-arch/vortex/html/starting_to_program.html#vortex_manual_securing_your_session"><i>TLS profile</i></a></li>

  <li><p><i>If your application protocol requires a ready made RPC
  framework</i>: you can use <a href="http://www.aspl.es/fact/files/af-arch/vortex/html/programming_with_xml_rpc.html"><i>XML-RPC profile</i></a>.
</ul>

<img class="article-image" alt="app-stack" src="app-stack.png"/>

<p>The advantage of this approach is that you design block (or reuse
them) to build modern and feature-rich application protocols that
won't stop you from adding more profiles, while previously deployed
applications keep working.</p>

<p>That is, if you don't like XML-RPC profile that's not a
problem. You can use it for the project initial stage and then add a
new RPC protocol more fitted to your requirements that co-exists
initially, allowing to perform a gradual application deploy. </p>

<h2>Mixing the RPC based solution with BEEP</h2>

<p>Seems we have two solutions, the RPC based solution and the BEEP
based solution, that offers desirable features, but initially, both
seems to be mutually exclusive. However, this not applies to BEEP.</p>

<p>The main advantage that comes with BEEP is that you can mix many
application protocols at the same time over the same connection. This
allows to take the best approach for every part of the application
protocol to be defined.</p>

<p>Using a RPC framework, will enforce you to use its invocation
semantic, message formats, etc. However, BEEP will allow you to easily
add more application protocols that coexist with previous one, as
<i>"profiles"</i>. </p>

<p>Now, define an application protocol, could mean to define it in
terms of mixing the <a
href="http://www.aspl.es/fact/files/af-arch/vortex/html/programming_with_xml_rpc.html">XML-RPC
over BEEP profile</a> and additional BEEP profiles required to fill
those part not properly addressed.</p>

<h2>Conclusion: putting all together</h2>

<p>We have seen that building a new application protocol can be
defined in terms of a <i>"request-response"</i> pattern, allowing to
use <i>"XML-RPC over BEEP"</i>, and reuse those parts not provided by
this profile like SASL and TLS. </p>

<p>For those part not covered by a <i>"request-response"</i> pattern,
or not implemented properly/efficiently by <i>"XML-RPC over BEEP"</i>,
a new profile can be added to fill the gap.</p>

<p>In fact, even knowing <i>"XML-RPC over BEEP"</i> won't be the
profile to be used in the production environment, it allows you to
prototype an network application protocol really fast.</p>

<p>Now, it only remains to reuse existing security and authentication
features already provided by BEEP to have a modern and robust application
protocol.</p>
