    Change Id: vortex-axllist-api-01
 Project name: Vortex Library
  Included in: already included and shipped with next stable release 1.0.3
       Status: NOTIFY
       Author: Francis Brosnan BlÃ¡zquez

Motivation
~~~~~~~~~~

Due to the ongoing work to remove the GLib dependency, previous
releases was using the GList type as a fundation to return a list of
items. This has been replaced with axlList.

The axlList type definition, comes from the Axl Library, and includes
a memory efficient implementation to avoid frequent allocation
patterns which are resolved into really few.

Change Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any function returning or receiving a (GList *) type, now does the
same but with axlList. 

For all functions that have been updated, are now included a brief
example of code showing how to use the list. 

The following are the set of functions that have been updated:

  - vortex_connection_get_remote_profiles
  - vortex_profiles_get_actual_list

Solution to incompatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previously, with both functions, it was required to done something
similar to the following to iterate over all elements found in the
returned list:

  list = vortex_connection_get_remote_profiles (connection);
  list = g_list_first (list)
  for (; list; g_list_next (list)) {
        printf ("uri found=%s\n", (char *)list->data);
  } 

Now, the same is done easily with:

  iterator = 0;
  list     = vortex_connection_get_remote_profiles (connection);
  while (iterator < axl_list_length (list)) {
        printf ("uri found=%s\n", axl_list_get_nth (list, iterator));
	iterator++;	
  } 
  // now it is required to remove the result, allowing to have 
  // an independent copy
  axl_list_free (list);

In both cases, the returned list is required to be deallocated.
