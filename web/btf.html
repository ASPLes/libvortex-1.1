<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>The article describes a problem which arises with bulk
  transfer (i.e. large files), that are segmented into messages slightly
  bigger than receiver's window size that causes a pathological
  interaction between the BEEP framing mechanism and the interaction
  between TCP Nagle's algorithm and TCP Delayed ACK, causing a performance throughput
  degradation which is stable in the time until the message size changes.</p>

<h2>How BTF arises</h2>

<p>Let's suppose the scenario where a BEEP peer wants to send a set of
  equally sized messages. Let's say that each message has 4098 bytes of useful content:</p>

<img src="btf-introduction.png" />  


<p>In the case the remote BEEP peer have a window size of at least
  4098 (and following SEQ frames issued have the same size), the send
  operation involving 4 messages are translated into 4 frames (1:1
mapping). In this case, <b>performance and transfer rates are OPTIMAL and no relevant delay is found.</b></p>

<p>Now, let's suppose the same scenario with one modification:
   messages to be sent (4098 bytes) are slightly bigger than current advised
   receiver's window size (4096 bytes).</p>

<p>In the case the remote BEEP peer has a smaller window size
   than message to be sent, let's say, 1 or 2 bytes less, the current
   BEEP stack must fragment content as follow:</p>

<img src="btf-how-it-arrises.png" />

<p>As the reader could observe, because the BEEP stack finds the
  remote receiver's window can't hold the entire message, it has to
  split the message into an initial frame (4096 bytes) and, once
  received the next SEQ frame, it sends the rest of message (2
  bytes). <i>NOTE: that the boundaries where split occur aren't
  relevant (i.e 4096), if the message is splitted into frames of 512
  bytes, and the ending frame contains 2 bytes, the same problem will arise.</i></p>

<p>As the send operation evolves, this pattern keeps stable, forcing
  each frame to be partially sent with a bigger one (with most of the
  content) followed by a tiny BEEP frame containing the rest of the
  message (in our case 2 bytes). </p>

<p>This "tiny BEEP frame" causes at the TCP layer to activate the Nagle's
  algorithm [4] as a countermeasure to avoid SWS [6], storing the content rather sending
  it directly, causing not only to delay this frame but next one. At
  the receiver's TCP stack, the TCP delay ACK algorithm will
  complement this <i>"wrong interaction"</i> (closing the circle) introducing ACK delays that makes the Nagle's
  algorithm at the sending side to retain the small frame until the
  receiver's TCK delay ACK timeout is reached.</p>

<h2>How BTF degrades throughput</h2>
  
<p>At initial approach to the problem could give the impression the
  performance penalty won't be bigger (as much as doing additional
sending round trips for the tiny BEEP fragments); however this is not
the case. </p>

<p>Experiments shows a great performance penalty. We are talking about
degrading a BEEP channel that is able to process 8192 operations in
a couple of seconds into only process 10 operations in the same amount
of time.</p>

<p>Here are the points that explain it:</p>

<ol>
  <li class="item-description"><span class="item-description">TCP Nagle's with TCP Delayed ACK interaction:</span><br><br>

  The most important reason behind delays introduced at the pattern
  described seems to be the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP Delayed ACK.<br><br>

  On this document([5]) we find that Nagle's algorithm interact
  with TCP delayed ACK in a way that two writes followed by one read
  causes delays that could be up to 500 ms (our
  experiments only shows delays of 40 ms on each message sent). This is
  interesting because pattern described where BTF arises implements
  two writes: a tiny frame followed by a big incomplete frame for the
  next message and then a wait to read a SEQ frame to continue with the
  transfer.<br><br>

  Because the BEEP framing mechanism produces in a continuous manner a
  pair of frames for each message to be sent (big (4094 bytes)
  followed by small frame (2 bytes)), this activates problem described
  at [5] with great probabilities than a plain TCP connection where no
  framing mechanism is running on top of it (BEEP).<br><br>

  </li>
  <li class="item-description">
  
  <span class="item-description">The amount of frames to be sent is twice (for the same application level information):</span><br><br>

  For our case,
  sending 30MB (31457280 bytes), in messages of 4098 bytes, with a
  window size of 4096, <b>will cause to send 15352 frames</b>, in a stable
  series of small frame, followed by a big frame (next message). <br><br>
  
  In a scenario where the same amount of information is sent, but in
  messages of 4096 bytes (or 4098 with a stable remote window
  available of 4098), will cause to <b>send roughly 7680
  frames.</b><br><br>

  Additionally, the side effect is that producing twice of frames for the same
  information also involves twice of read operations at the remote
  side.<br><br>

  </li>
  <li class="item-description"><span class="item-description">Frames produced requires "additional" work
  to be processed (at both sides):</span><br><br>
  Because the message to be sent is bigger than available window size,
  half of the frames produced are flagged as incomplete (more flag
  activated). The other half is the set of tiny fragments that
  completes its preceding frame.<br><br>

  At the sending BEEP peer, this requires a partial send operation,
  and to always queue the rest of the message. That is, it is required
  a queue operation for each message to be sent because it never fit
  into the receiver's window size. It also activates splitting code
  which involves an additional logic and memory operations not required
  for complete frames. All this "extra" work makes the sending BEEP
  peer to quickly enter into a trashing state where it spends more
  time splitting and queueing than actually send.<br><br>

  At the receiving BEEP peer, this requires additional work to process
  frames received. Because half of frames received are never
  complete, it usually requires to store them as pending to be completed,
  and an additional joining operation once the tiny fragment is
  received. <br><br>

  It is worth to mention that a frame read operation is an
  expensive operation. The amount of work required to move a BEEP engine to read a frame of useful
  content of 4096 is the same as 2 bytes.
  
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Analysis of solutions</h2>

<p>Initial work to propose a solution was focused to improve memory
handling and efficiency at the process of reading/writing fragmented
frames. Soon it was found that even having interesting improvement,
no effect was found: a great delay was still found with the transfer
test (30MB).</p>

<p>Later, some interesting results were found if the message size used
was aligned with the receiver's window size. That is, assuming a
default window size of 4096 bytes, if the sending application performs
the transfer of the file using chunks of 4096, 2048, 1024 or 512, an
strong improvement was found (being 4096 the most effective transfer
size). </p>

<p>This moved us to think that there was a bug buried inside the
Vortex [7] engine code, causing this unacceptable delay for frame sizes
that produces an ending frame of really small content (2 up to 150
bytes), that is, splitting sizes not aligned with remote receiver's
window size.</p>

<p>No debugging and profiling tool was able spot the cause of the
problem. The results found from these tools were that there was no delay
at all. </p>

<p>From this confusing results, we started to measure times between
each write/read at both sides. Surprisingly, we found no delay was
produced by the Vortex engine; however data sent was "delayed at some
place", inside OS TCP send implementation.</p>

<p>With some investigation we found that disabling Nagle's algorithm
(setsockopt TCP_NODELAY option [8]) fixes the problem, making all
transfers done with different message splitting sizes to keep under
reasonable values.</p>

<p>Later we found that a similar issue was found with the X window
System (as pointed at [4]) and a detailed description that exactly
describes our problem at [5].</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>We have seen how the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and the
TCP delayed ACK algorithm produced bad transfer rates, that are easily
activated by the BEEP framing mechanism.</p>

<p>From these results we can conclude that:</p>

<ol>
  
<li>Having Nagle's algorithm activated by default, makes the BEEP
stack to not produces proper results. The main explanation for this
poor interaction is that there is a flow control mechanism inside BEEP
(SEQ frame) that causes the application level to not send more frames
until a SEQ frame is received.<br><br>

These "application level sending stops" makes more likely to activate
the problem described at [5] than the situation where the application
level can send the same set of data without <i>"waiting"</i> on each
  message sent (wait caused by waiting for SEQ frames to continue with the transfer).<br><br>

To corroborate this, it was tested to perform the same transfer test
with the values that trigger the problem (message size: 4098, message
splitting size: 4096) but having the receiver with a window size of
8192 and no delay was found.<br><br>

<b>So, we can conclude it is recommended to disable Nagle's algorithm</b>. <br><br>
</li>

<li>Producing/pushing BEEP messages to be sent without considering its
interaction with BEEP framing mechanism could make the BEEP stack to
produce and process twice of frames, to send the same amount of effective
information.<br><br>

For this, it is recommended that BEEP stacks should provide some sort
of API that allows to get remote receiver's window size so the
implementer can use this value to produce messages that are smaller
and aligned with this value to avoid message fragmentation and, if the
fragmentation happens, to avoid producing small content
frames. <br><br>

In the other hand, it is recommended that BEEP stacks updates window
sizes with values aligned with values already advised. That is, having
advised an initial value of 4096 bytes, it is recommended to use the
same value for following updates or values aligned to it such 8192,
12288 (1024 bytes x N >= 4). This will implement a predictable behavior that helps to improve bulk transfer.<br><br>
