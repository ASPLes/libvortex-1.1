<h3>Using Vortex Library community list</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.aspl.es">Advanced Software Production Line,
  S.L.</a> have created Vortex Library and then released it in an open
  source terms, following the company policy. However, this do not
  implies professional support. </p>

<p>Our vision is based on the principle of Quid Pro Quo, <i>something
  for something</i>, pretty much like other Open Source companies like
  My SQL, Sleepycat or Trolltech.</p>

<p>This means we are providing Vortex Library under a license term
  that allows you to develop open source as well as commercial
  applications, in exchange of receiving valuable feedback bug
  reports, patchs and all improvements that could make Vortex Library
  an even better project.</p>

<p>The community list is provided to make users to exchange
  information and experience while using Vortex Library, but a minimal
set of rules
  must be followed:</p>

<ol>
  
 <li><p>To properly report a bug or requiring some assistance, you must
  elaborate a complete description of the problem, with real examples
  (not pseudocode) that could make people to make easier to give
  feedback. It must be clear that you have spent your time giving a
  try to the problem.</p>

  <p>In general, people do not want to spend its valuable time helping
  people which is not providing something in return to the project.</p>
 </li>

 <li><p>You must have patience. The community support mailing list is
 provided and supported by people which may have no time to reply or
 simply they don't have the answer.</p>
 </li>
</ol>

<p>Keeping in mind previous information, if your company have the
  intention to produce a product, which requires
  professional and ensured support services, you should purchase a
  support contract. See more details at: <a
  href="professional.html">Professional services</a>.
