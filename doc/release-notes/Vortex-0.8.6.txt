Release note
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Advanced Software Production Line is proud to announce the Vortex
  Library 0.8.6 availability: an open source "BEEP Core" protocol
  implementation written in C and mapped into TCP/IP.

  Vortex Library is a powerful toolkit to write new application
  protocols and application over the well-defined "BEEP Core" protocol
  defined at RFC3080/RFC3081. 

  Vortex Library has been developed inside the Af-Arch project as its
  data transport layer. 

  Vortex Library is a stable and robust application protocol
  development toolkit. Currently it is running under Microsoft Windows
  and GNU/Linux platforms.

  Check out the following links to get ready with Vortex Library:

      being developed.

The release in short
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  This relase is mainly focused on minor bug fixings and a long term
  bug caused inside the interaction between the Vortex Sequencer and
  the Vortex Writer. Project manuals and API have been updated.


Changes since 0.8.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   * making vortex_semaphore_down_n to just return when is requested
     to down the semaphore 0 units.

   * making vortex writer code cleanups:
     __vortex_writer_build_set_to_watch and
     __vortex_writer_read_pending function now uses the same code.

   * making vortex writer to down one unit vortex sequencer semaphore everytime
     is found messages flaged to be sent but not message actually was
     sent.

   * fixing a function name __vorter_listener_get_port to
     __vortex_listener_get_port

   * adding additional check to vortex_connection_is_ok (socket sanity
     checks)

   * removed code added at revision 1664 on vortex_writer to reduce
     the vortex_sequencer_semaphore units under some circumstances. 

   * fixing a bug on vortex_connection_is_ok function making to not
     work properly if free-resources-on-fail was set.

   * adding a new API to vortex_hash_table module: vortex_hash_clear
     which allows to clear all items stored on a VortexHash.

   * added a new API to vortex_connection module: vortex_connection_reconnect
     which allows to performa a reconnection using actual connection's
     settings. 

   * making vortex_connection_close to just return is a null reference is
     recieved.

   * making vortex_channel_pool_close to not perform any channel
     removal if it is detected there is not channel to remove.

   * improved vortex_connection_close to detect if the connection
     being close is already opened or it is not connected making
     posible to just unref resources allocated or to perform
     environmental operations to close opened channels and the unref
     resources.

   * improved vortex_connection_unref: fixed a posible race condition.

   * added some internal notes to vortex_connection_free function,
     fixing a typo error in the vortex_channel module.

   * making vortex_queue_push function to return if the data was pushed
     on the queue or not. vortex_queue_push now returns a gboolean
     value to notify this status.

   * making vortex_channel_queue_frame to return a boolean value to
     notify is the packet was cleanly pushed. Making also this
     function to check the connection status before queuing the data.

   * improving vortex sequencer to be more fault tolerance on
     connection errors.

     - Now, the vortex sequencer ref and unref the connection involved
       in the message sequencing to avoid race conditions between a
       message being sequenced over a connection that is closed in the
       middle of that process.

     - Now, the vortex sequencer pay attention to the connection
       status and the status returned by the package queuing. This
       allow to not signal message that finally weren't queued due a
       connection failure.
