Release note
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Advanced Software Production Line is proud to announce Vortex
  Library 1.1.16 "Elephant in the Room" release availability: an open
  source "BEEP Core" protocol implementation written in C, mapped onto
  TCP/IP.

  Vortex Library is a stable and robust application protocol
  development toolkit, with active support for Microsoft Windows and
  GNU/Linux platforms.

This release in short
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  - Added Vortex External module to allow easily creating BEEP over
    any connection oriented transport by providing a set of handlers
    that implements the specific part of the protocol supported. Used
    this new transport to support BEEP over BlueTooth (done by Arthur
    Kristmann).

  - Fixed mutex API to provide a consistent behaviour (recursive vs
    non-recursive) and added new API to provide this support. Reported
    by Ralf Konusch. 

  - Fixed tls digest segfault (reported by Ralf Konusch).

  - Removed wrong nopoll.h header from vortex_external.h (Arthur
    Kristmann).

  - Various stable improvements and new regression tests.

Changes since 1.1.15
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* [fix] Updated vortex_websocket_connection_new to use a default
  connect timeout of 60 seconds when it is not defined or it is
  0. This fixes those connections that takes some time to finish the
  initial WebSocket handshake to give then a chance to to the BEEP
  greetings. Discovered by turbulence reg test (test_25) with a low
  resources machine.

* [new] Added new extension library (vortex external) that allows to
  create BEEP connections over external created and unknown transports
  provided they have a socket like watchable API and connection
  oriented state.  API added:

    - vortex_external_setup_new  
    - vortex_external_setup_ref
    - vortex_external_setup_unref
    - vortex_external_setup_conf
    - vortex_external_connection_new
    - vortex_external_listener_new
    - VORTEX_EXTERNAL_CONF_MUTEX_IO
    - VORTEX_EXTERNAL_CONF_HOST
    - VORTEX_EXTERNAL_CONF_PORT
    - VORTEX_EXTERNAL_ON_PREPARE_HANDLER
    - VORTEX_EXTERNAL_ON_PREPARE_USER_DATA
    - VORTEX_EXTERNAL_ON_PREPARE_USER_DATA2

  Added regression test (test_21) to check this new API that for now
  uses socketpair to create a pair of connected BEEP connections that
  works at the same time as initiators..

  Updated Vortex Connection internal API to allow skipping naming
  checking and session setup.

* [fix] Added more code to implement vortex external listener
  API. Added regression test_22. 

* [fix] Added more updates to vortex_external_listener_new
  (completed).  Added working regression test (test_22) to check
  support added. Added additional documentation to explain how to use
  this.

* [fix] Adding and fixing documentation to include references to BEEP
  over WebSocket and BEEP over external (like BlueTooth).

* [fix] Adding more documentation updates explaining how to use vortex
  external module..

* [fix] Removed nopoll.h reference used by vortex_external.h, not
  needed (reported by Arthur Kristmann)

* [fix] Updated vortex_listener and vortex_external modules to skip
  naming checking (getnameinfio) when accepting a connection using the
  external interface.

* [fix] Adding files to build FreeBSD amd64 10.X: 10-x86-64

* [fix] Several updates to compile web-socket and external components
  for windows build..

* [fix] Several updates to include .def generation without linking it
  into building process.

* [fix] Several updates to make building process for win64 to produce
  right .lib files. Simplified configuration...

* [new] Updated vortex ctx API to allow controlling write timeout (to
  disable it or to increase its default value):

  - vortex_ctx_close_conn_on_write_timeout 
  - vortex_ctx_write_timeout

* [fix] Updated .def files to cover new apis for write timeout
  control..

* [new] Adding new API to check what are the number of channels with
  pending operations at the vortex sequencer..

* [fix] Fixed implementation of vortex_connection_get_pending_msgs..

* [fix] Updated vortex_mutex_create to use CreateSemaphore with a a
  initial value of 1 rather than CreateMutex to implement a non
  recursive behaviour for vortex_mutex_lock and vortex_mutex_unlock
  (Reported by Ralf Konusch).
  
* [new] Added support to configure and create recursive mutexes. API
  added:
  
  - vortex_mutex_create_full
  - VortexMutexConf

* [fix] Updated vortex-regression-client.c to include additional
  checks to ensure vortex_mutex_create_full with recursive option
  works well..

* [fix] Added additional code vortex vortex_mutex_unlock to detect if
  we are working on windows with a mutex or semaphore..

* [fix] Adding additional code to mutex handling (on windows) to be
  able to differentiate between recursive and non-recursive mutexes and
  how they are unlocked..

* [fix] Several updates on mutex handling for windows (win32).  Now it
  uses a internal structure (VortexWin32Mutex) that allows to hold
  additional information about the kind of mutex (mutex or semaphore)
  and configuration received.

* [fix] Fixed vortex_tls_get_peer_ssl_digest to use
  vortex_tls_get_digest (fixes error reported by Ralf Konusch). Added
  regression test_00g to check vortex_tls_get_digest and updated
  test_05 to check vortex_tls_get_peer_ssl_digest it is working..

* [fix] Fixed various issues spotted by gcc (5.3.1) at the xml-rpc-gen
  compiler
