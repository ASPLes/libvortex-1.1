Change notifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  None

Thanks to..
~~~~~~~~~~~

  - Ralf Konusch (provided backward compatible support for
    applications using old vortex mutex behaviour, also added various
    corrections to make tls digest API to generate values that are
    compatible out of the box with OpenSSL results).

Changes since 1.1.16
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* [fix] Added support for Ubuntu 16.04 xenial xerus

* [fix] Updated debian files for Jessie..

* [fix] Change Vortex 1.1.16 mutex API extensions to be downward
  compatible to applications compiled against older Vortex releases.

* [fix] Updated vortex_mutex_create and vortex_mutex_destroy to check
  internal references to avoid working with null pointers (on win32
  implementation).

* [fix] Several updates to make better report some errors detected at
  vortex-regression-client.c on windows platform.

* [fix] Removed Makefile.win.in file which is now handled manually

* [fix] Added tool vortex-digest-tool to support reporting values that
  matches vortex_tls_get_peer_ssl_digest. Updated documentation for
  that function to explain why it will not match with openssl command
  tool output and how to get that value using added
  vortex-digest-tool.c

* [fix] Updated vortex-digest-tool (.c) to allow configuring digest to
  use and verbose operation

* [fix] Updated configure.ac to detect openssl TLS protocols
  available.

* [fix] Added missing pthread_mutexattr_destroy calls after
  pthread_mutex_init (linux impl).

* [fix] Updated test_05_a2 to include a check to ensure the value
  reported by vortex-digest-tool is the same as
  vortex_tls_get_peer_ssl_digest

* [Fix] Additional updates to make vortex-digest-tool.c compilable for
  windows (also added additional code needed for this platform).
  
* [fix] Fixed Makefile.am to avoid having a reference to
  Makefile.win.in..

* [fix] added some notes about how to configure serverName

* [fix] Vortex TLS digest API call modifications

  - Correction of the vortex_tls_get_peer_ssl_digest() result
  - new internal method __translateToOctal()
  - new TLS API call vortex_tls_get_ssl_digest()

* [fix] Vortex TLS digest API call modifications. Added
  vortex_tls_get_ssl_digest () Updated vortex-digest-tool to use this
  new API so now this tool, the API function and openssl digest md5
  report the value value.
  
* [fix] Naming and syntax corrections last pull request. Updated
  test_05_a2 reg test to pass.

* [fix] Updated vortex_tls_get_ssl_digest to include additional calls
  to release SSL objects..

* [fix] Minor code corrections at vortex_tls.c module

* [fix] Add new API "vortex_tls_get_ssl_digest" to Export Definition
  File

* [fix] Added missing API "vortex_tls_get_ssl_digest" to Export
  Definition File (libvortex-tls-1.1.def)

* [fix] Updated vortex_tls documentation to explain serverName
  parameter indicating its relation with previous channels..

* [fix] Updated vortex_tls.c module to include more information about
  serverName parameter

* [fix] Using Vortex-tls API vortex_tls_get_ssl_digest() causes a
  segmentation fault by freeing a structure twice.

* [fix] Fixed vortex_connection_get_host_ip to also support listener
  connections (it was only supporting client connections).

* [fix] Improved error reporting for vortex_support_pipe to detect and
  better handle when the pipe was not created because loopback
  interface errors..

* [fix] Updated buildrpm.sh to check error code and stop failing
  reporting that error..

* [fix] Adding missing file to build rpm packages for Centos7

* [fix] More updates to have Vortex packaged for Centos7

* [fix] Several updates to vortex.spec to have support for Centos7
  packages. Updated py-vortex/src/Makefile.am to avoid breaking rpm
  build
