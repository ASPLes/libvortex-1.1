    * Fixed hostname handling at SASL module to use hostname provided
      by the caller instead of current local server name (reported and
      fixed by Matthias Petter Wimmer)

    * Fixed wrong axl version referenced from 0.6.4 to 0.7.0

  - Robert Münch

    * Reported wrong vsnprintf header definition when log is enabled
      on Mac/OSX

    * Reported various NULL values returned as axl_false at
      __vortex_connection_new

  - Ralf Konush

    * Reported header redefinitions using various Visual Studio
      versions

Changes since 1.1.14
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* [fix] Several updates to make the vortex bundle for w32 to include
  libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll by default...

* [fix] Fixed xml-rpc-gen-1.1 to produce Makefile.am files that
  separates headers from sources so headers are installed for client
  libraries.

* [fix] Fixed some unused result warnings found at py-vortex module.

* [fix] Updated vortex_tls_log_ssl to avoid buffer overflow when not
  found openssl error format.

* [fix] Several updates to make libvortex-1.1 ssl API to allow loading
  certificates from a PEM certificate loaded from memory. Now this
  method is supported along with the previously one which is loading
  PEM certificates from files. Now it is possible to load a certificate
  and then use it at the right moment without having to have especial
  permissions.
   
* [fix] Some cleanups at PyVortex to better handle wrong connection
  references received at channel pool creation.

* [fix] Documentation updates on VortexTlsCertificateFileLocator and
  VortexTlsPrivateKeyFileLocator

* [fix] Improved waiting code to send all pending replies just after
  sending greeting after TLS handshake.

* [fix] Several updates to make vortex_tls module to notify additional
  information about timeout settings, when it was started, when
  stopped and what connection the message applies when a timeout is
  reached during sync TLS activation.

* [fix] Making vortex.tls.start_tls to allow threading (other python
  functions) when called.

* [fix] Making vortex_connection_ref_internal to report
  connection->ref_count > 1 instead of axl_true. There are suspicions
  that some race may cause reporting true when in fact the reference
  isn't working.

* [fix] Removed --Werror from building autogen.sh.

* [fix] Added additional checks to avoid defining vsnprintf header
  when log is enabled on Mac/OSX (reported by Robert Münch).

* [fix] Fixed reporting NULL instead of axl_false in
  __vortex_connection_new (reported by Robert Münch).

* [fix] Fixed vortex-client.c warning reported by clang.

* [fix] Updated autogen.sh to allow supporting Centos packaging..

* [fix] Several updates to fix compile errors when enabling stack
  protector with gcc.

* [fix] Added initial working files to produce rpm packages.

* [fix] Updated vortex-web-socket API to include an option to allow
  disabling certificate verification. API added:
  
   - VORTEX_WEBSOCKET_CONF_CERT_VERIFY

* [fix] Fixed libaxl wrong version reference, moving it from 0.6.4 to
  0.7.0 (reported by Matthias Peter Wimmer).

* [fix] Updated hostname handling done by SASL module to make client
  initiator to report and use HOSTNAME configured by the caller or the
  value reported by vortex_sasl_get_server_name or
  vortex_sasl_get_host (), instead of current local server name. Bug
  reported by fixed by Matthias Petter Wimmer).

* [fix] Fixed args reference used at main module to have Vortex
  compiled for Android.

* [fix] Added several updates to support detecting nopoll, gsasl and
  axl even when pkg-config is not present..

* [fix] Updated configure.ac file to detect if bash is outside common
  location to detect those cases before continue.

* [fix] Removed call to freeaddrinfo() when getaddrinfo() fails. It is
  segfaulting application on FreeBSD.

* [fix] Updated configure.ac to fix pkg-config output which is broken on FreeBSD.


* [fix] Fixed regression test (vortex-regression-listener.c) to grab a
  reference to the connection to implement connection close checks for
  reg-test (test_15).

* [fix] Updated thread pool event removal handler to check ctx and
  ctx->thread_pool references.

* [fix] Adding initial files to support creating binary packages for
  FreeBSD 9.X

* [fix] Adding packaging support for http, pull,sasl and tls modules
  for FreeBSD..

* [fix] Adding package descriptions for libvortex-1.1 (tunnel)
  extensions for FreeBSD

* [fix] Adding websocket packaging for FreeBSD..

* [fix] Adding packaging support for xml-rpc modules for FreeBSD

* [fix] Added FreeBSD packing support for python-vortex

* [fix] Added more code to configure.ac to detect alternative
  locations for axl.pc

* [fix] Updated freebsd directories to avoid using :

* [fix] Fixing references when websocket support is disabled.

* [fix] Fixed .def rebuilding at main Makefile.am causing compilation
  problems when optional modules like tls, web-socket or sasl aren't
  enabled.

* [fix] Updated vortex.h to allow defining a VORTEX_SKIP_ERRNO_REDEF
  variable to avoid errno redefinition on windows (which seems to be 
  causing problems in Visual Studio 12).

* [fix] Added code to detect Visual Studio 11 2012 and above to avoid
  errno redefinition.

* [fix] Applied some updates in vortex.h to avoid header redefinition warnings
  (reported by Ralf Konush).
