Release note
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Advanced Software Production Line is proud to announce the Vortex
  Library 1.0.9 "a certain share of green" release availability: an
  open source "BEEP Core" protocol implementation written in C, mapped
  onto TCP/IP.

  Vortex Library has been developed inside the Af-Arch project as its
  data transport layer.

  Vortex Library is a stable and robust application protocol
  development toolkit. Currently it is running under Microsoft Windows
  and GNU/Linux platforms.

The release in short
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Integration of some bug fixes affecting binary transfers. This
  release also updates the serialize support for ANS/NUL frame types
  making easier to transfer files. 
  
Change notifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  None.

Changes since 1.0.8
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* [fix] Updated documentation and removed checking inside the vortex
  listener module which was causing to not start a listener if no
  profile was found registered. This is no longer required due to the
  dynamic character provided by applications like Turbulence.

* [fix] Updated documentation explaining how to use ANS/NUL frame.

* [new] Updated regression test to check ANS/NUL pattern
  (test_04a). No bug found. Test kept for future checkings.

* [fix] Updated regression test to use an optimal transfer value for
  the regression test associated to the ANS/NUL pattern.

* [fix] Making vortex_channel_set_serialize to how activate frame
  serialization for ANS/NUL pattern. Updated regression tests to check
  this new function.

* [new] Added two new examples that allows to transfer a file from a
  server using ANS/NUL pattern and one big message. Files added:
  
   - vortex-file-transfer-client.c
   - vortex-file-transfer-server.c

* [fix] Updating version file and allowing
  vortex-file-transfer-client.c to allow configuring the host and port
  for the file server.

* [fix] Updated vortex_channel_set_serialize documentation and updated
  vortex_channel_pool_new to make profile parameter to be a const char *.

* [new] Added a new test to check binary transfers for zeroed chunks.

* [fix] Fixed bug which was causing to not detect previous frame
  fragment received if the content transfered is binary content that
  contains zeroed elements.

* [fix] Making vortex sequencer and vortex reader to use an stack
  activated variable to hold data provided
  vortex_sequencer_direct_send, allowing to save one memory
  allocation/deallocation pattern for each fragment sent.

* [fix] Added some "const" declarations at the vortex_channel_pool_new
  and vortex_channel_pool_new_full.

* [fix] Making vortex_connection_close to check and detect those calls
  to this function using references created by vortex_listener_new functions
  which, at the same time, did not update reference counting, causing 
  double deallocation patterns.

* [fix] minor cleanup at the vortex listener module.

* [fix] Committing changes to files to make doxygen to properly create
  documentation.
