Changes since 1.1.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* [fix] Removing not required sentence to configure channel to be not
  opened during its creation. This is already done by
  vortex_channel_empty_new. Fix imported from 1.0. Reported by Benoit
  Amiaux. Fixed crash based on a race condition activated by this
  sentence.

* [fix] Applied changes to make the project compilable (test files and
  regression tests) if not TLS support is added.

* [fix] Making test directory to be compilable without sasl support.

* [fix] General project changes to make vortex compilable when sources
  and installation directories aren't different.

* [fix] Removing spurious comma after enum declaration. Added missing
  vortex-tls.dtd.h and vortex-sasl.dtd.h to distribution.  (Reported
  Lawrence MacIntyre).

* [fix] Applied vortex-notify-start-01 (CHANGE-NOTIFY). Updated
  regression tests to check changes introduced.

* [fix] Fixing a documentation on vortex_channel_new*

* [fix] Improving comment dropped by vortex_reader module when
  something has to be read from the wire...

* [fix] Moved mutex release after frame variable configuration inside
  CHECK_PENDING_FRAME (vortex_channel.c).

* [fix] Fixed dependencies with GSASL libraries on windows.  Updated
   gsasl.nsi and gsasl-win32-compile.txt with latest instructions.

* [fix] Adding c++ extern header decls in all extensions to make them
  usable for c++ users/compilers. This directive wasn't imported from
  base library (Problem reported by Juhani).

* [fix] Making xml-rpc-gen-1.1 tool to include xml-rpc.dtd as a header
  created by axl-knife. Now it is no longer required to bundle
  xml-rpc.dtd file.

* [fix] Moving vortex_sasl.dtd.h include file from public header to
  vortex_sasl.c to avoid users to include it.

* [fix] Adding references to debian package support for vortex.

* [fix] General update to add debian package support.
