    Change Id: vortex-ctx-data-01
 Project name: Vortex Library
  Included in: already included and to be shipped with next stable release
               1.1.10
       Status: NOTIFY
       Author: Francis Brosnan Bl√°zquez

Motivation
~~~~~~~~~~

Functions vortex_ctx_set_data, vortex_ctx_set_data_full,
vortex_ctx_get_data provides a string key oriented hash storage
associated for vortex context, but key parameter's type is an
axlPointer which allows passing keys which aren't string, causing
obvious runtime problems which aren't detected by c/c++ compilers.

Change Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These tree functions has being updated to receive a const char * for
the key parameter, like showed for vortex_ctx_set_data:

  void        vortex_ctx_set_data                  (VortexCtx       * ctx, 
						    const char      * key, 
						    axlPointer        value);

Solution to incompatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In many cases this API change won't cause problems. However, because
"const" declaration, you may need to cast references (const char *),
especially for those buildings that flags compile warnings as errors.
