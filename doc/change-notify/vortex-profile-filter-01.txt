    Change Id: vortex-profile-filter-01
 Project name: Vortex Library
  Included in: already included and to be shipped with next stable release
               1.1.3
       Status: NOTIFY
       Author: Francis Brosnan Bl√°zquez

Motivation
~~~~~~~~~~

The function vortex_connection_is_profile_filtered is used to
implement greetings and channel start filtering at connection
level. Currently the API do not provide all data that may be required
to filter profile content and other details inside the frame received
carrying the channel start.

This change notification updates this API to also provide these
details.

Change Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The function vortex_connection_is_profile_filtered is updated to
include encoding parameter (which signals which encoding is being used
at profile content) and a frame parameter which includes the frame
that holds the channel start request.

axl_bool          
    vortex_connection_is_profile_filtered    
                (VortexConnection      * connection,
		 int                     channel_num,
		 const char            * uri,
		 const char            * profile_content,
		 VortexEncoding          encoding,
		 const char            * serverName,
		 VortexFrame           * frame,
		 char                 ** error_msg);

In the same direction, VortexProfileMaskFunc, which has a direct
relation with previous since it contains the same set of parameters,
is now updated to the following:

axl_bool
    (* VortexProfileMaskFunc)       
                (VortexConnection      * connection,
		 int                     channel_num,
		 const char            * uri,
		 const char            * profile_content,
		 VortexEncoding          encoding,
		 const char            * serverName,
		 VortexFrame           * frame,
		 char                 ** error_msg,
		 axlPointer              user_data);

In both cases, parameters added are:

  - VortexEncoding    encoding
  - VortexFrame     * frame

Solution to incompatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This change notifications creates an API incompatibility with previous
releases. The only solution is to update all references to the handler
and function updated.
