    Change Id: vortex-xml-rpc-gen-dispatch-01
 Project name: Vortex Library
  Included in: already included and shipped with next stable release
               1.0.5
       Status: NOTIFY
       Author: Francis Brosnan Bl√°zquez

Motivation
~~~~~~~~~~

An update to the xml-rpc-gen server side generated code have been
introduced to allow functions handling XML-RPC services to also
receive a reference to the channel where the invocation was
received. 

Change Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The service handler generated by xml-rpc-gen tool now includes a
reference to the VortexChannel where the invocation was received. 

The following function have been also modified to allow providing the
channel reference:

   - vortex_xml_rpc_unmarshall_int_sync
   - vortex_xml_rpc_unmarshall_string_sync
   - vortex_xml_rpc_unmarshall_double_sync
   - vortex_xml_rpc_unmarshall_struct_sync
   - vortex_xml_rpc_unmarshall_array_sync


Solution to incompatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Functions that have been updated and the xml-rpc-gen tool are commonly
used for the unmarshall process that translates the XmlRpc data
received into a native representation to perform the invocation at the
server side.

Assuming you are using the xml-rpc-gen tool to build the XML-RPC
server, you must refresh the content of your server to make your
component compatible with the API introduced. 

For the rest of the cases that uses directly previous functions
without using the xml-rpc-gen tool, it is required to provide the
missing channel reference.
