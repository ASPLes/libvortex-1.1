    Change Id: vortex-inline-dtd-01
 Project name: Vortex Library
  Included in: already included and to be shipped with next stable release
               1.0.14 (also updated 1.1 branch)
       Status: NOTIFY
       Author: Francis Brosnan Bl√°zquez

Motivation
~~~~~~~~~~

A common issue reported while using Vortex Library is its
initialization and how to locate data files required for its functions
(mainly DTD files). The change proposed uses the DTD to C features
provided by axl-knife tool (included inside Axl Library, starting from
0.4.15) to make all DTD used by the library to be included as inline
code.

The intention with the change is to remove a common problem reported,
minimize installation files required by vortex, avoid including
platform specific code to only locate data files and to keep on using
DTD files to validate content.

Change Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using --dtd-to-c option from axl-knife command line tool, the
following new files have been created:

  - vortex-channel.dtd.h
  - vortex-tls.dtd.h
  - vortex-sasl.dtd.h
  - xml-rpc-boot.dtd.h
  - vortex-listener-conf.dtd.h

Vortex Library building files have been also updated to refresh these
files if the corresponding master copy change.

These files are private headers included from vortex_dtd.c and
vortex_listener.c module. They are only required at compilation time,
and, in any case, required at the installation.

Solution to incompatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No incompatibility has been created. Now DTD files from ../data
directory are no longer required (they will be ignored by the
running library).
