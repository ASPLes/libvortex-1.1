/** 
 * @brief Creates a new pool of \ref VortexChannel items, that are managed
 * in a way that ensure better throutput relation.
 * 
 * This module was created to allow having a pool of pre-created
 * channels (\ref VortexChannel) to be used over and over again during the application
 * life.
 * 
 * Because channel creation and channel close is an expensive process
 * (especially due to all requirements to be meet during channel
 * close), the channel pool can help to improve greatly your
 * application communication throughput, considering the relation
 * between request/replies received on a selected connection (\ref VortexConnection).
 * 
 * Keep in mind the following facts which may help you to chose using
 * vortex channel pool instead of controlling yourself channels
 * created on a particular connection.
 *
 * <ul>
 * 
 *   <li>If an application needs to not be blocked while sending
 *   messages you have to use a new channel or a channel that is not
 *   waiting for a reply, so new messages (requests) are not blocked
 *   by replies for previous messages (requests).
 * 
 *   BEEP RFC definition states: <i>"any message sent will be
 *   delivered in order at the remote peer and remote peer <b>must</b>
 *   reply the message receive in the same order."</i>
 *
 *   As a consequence, if message a and b are sent over channel 1, the
 *   message reply for b won't be received until message reply for a
 *   is received. 
 *
 *   In other words, if your applications needs to have a and b
 *   message to be managed independently, you'll have to use different
 *   channel, making each interaction to be independent, and those
 *   channels must not be waiting for a previous reply (\ref vortex_channel_is_ready).</li>
 *
 *   <li>To start a channel needs two message to be exchanged between
 *   peers and, of course, the channel creation can be denied by remote
 *   peer. This have a considerable overhead.</li>
 *   
 *   <li>To close a channel needs two message to be exchanged between
 *   peers and remote peers may accept channel to be closed at any
 *   time. This is not only a overhead problem but also great
 *   performance impact problem if your application close channels
 *   frequently.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The \ref VortexChannelPool allows you to create a pool of channels
 * and reuse then on next operations, saving starts/close operations,
 * based on the readyness of channels inside the pool.
 * 
 * This notion of "ready to be used" means that the channel have no
 * pending replies to be received so if you application send a message
 * it will receive the reply as soon as possible (\ref vortex_channel_is_ready).
 * 
 * Actually the reply can be really late due to remote peer processing
 * but it will not be delayed by messages previously sent, awaiting
 * for replies.
 *
 * Once you create a pool you can get its actual size, add or remove
 * channel from the pool or attach new channel that weren't created by
 * this module. In general, we can consider that there are two ways to
 * use the channel pool once created:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 *
 *  Allow the channel pool to manage the channel creation (setting
 * all data to be used at this function: start handler, frame
 * received, etc..). In this context you must use the following
 * function to add and remove channels to the pool:
 *
 *   - \ref vortex_channel_pool_add
 *   - \ref vortex_channel_pool_remove 
 *
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * 
 * In the case that the channel creation is too complex or the
 * application level wants to control the channel creation process,
 * you must use the following functions to add channels to the pool:
 * 
 *  - \ref vortex_channel_pool_attach
 *  - \ref vortex_channel_pool_deattach
 *
 * This method have a problem: automatic channel creation is not
 * activated. The channel pool could react by adding more channels if
 * a channel is requested but no channel is available (\ref vortex_channel_pool_get_next_ready). 
 * 
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 *  
 *
 * In the case that channel creation process is managed by the channel
 * pool, all of them will be created over the given session
 * (<i>connection</i>) and will be created under the semantics defined
 * by <i>profile</i>. The function will block you until all channels
 * are created. During the channel creation process one channel may
 * fail to be created so you should check how many channels have been
 * really created.
 *
 * You can create several channel pools over the same
 * connection. Every channel pool is identified by an id. This Id can
 * be used to lookup certain channel pool into a given connection.
 * 
 * Once a channel pool is created, it is associated with the given
 * connection so calls to \ref vortex_connection_get_channel_pool over a
 * connection will return the pool created. You can of course hold a
 * reference to your channel pool and avoid using previous function.
 *
 * The function \ref vortex_channel_pool_get_next_ready will return
 * the next channel ready to be used. But this function may return
 * NULL if no channel is ready to be used. You can optionally set the
 * auto_inc parameter to increase channel pool size to resolve your
 * petition.
 *
 * Once the channel retreived from the channel pool is no longer
 * required, it is "returned to the channel pool", to be usable by
 * other queries, by calling to \ref vortex_channel_pool_release_channel.
 *
 * See this section which contains more information about using the channel pool: \ref vortex_manual_implementing_request_response_pattern.

/** 
 * @brief Allows to create a new \ref VortexChannelPool providing a
 * function that is called to create channel rather allowing the pool
 * to call \ref vortex_channel_new directly.
 *
 * This function works the same way as \ref vortex_channel_pool_new
 * but, it allows to provide the creation function to be used to
 * initiate channels inside the pool.
 * 
 * Some BEEP profiles are simple and have no especial initial
 * handshake to create the channel properly. In that case you can use
 * safely \ref vortex_channel_pool_new. However, other BEEP
 * profiles includes an initial negotiation that requires more
 * steps to be taken in addition to \ref vortex_channel_new. 
 *
 * This is the case of the XML-RPC profile which once the channel is
 * created, it requires to change the channel into a boot state by
 * exchanging boot resource message and receiving a boot reply.
 *
 * Because the channel pool has a generic channel creation code, it
 * doesn't have the enough knowledge to create the channel properly,
 * so it delegates that task to the \ref VortexChannelPoolCreate
 * "create_channel" handler. This handler must return a properly
 * created and ready to use channel so the channel pool can manage it.

 *
 * @param profile                  The profile the channels will use.

 *
 * @param create_channel           Handler to the channel creation function.

 * the create channel function for the first creation.

 * This function returns the next "ready to use" channel from the
 * given pool. Because a vortex channel pool may have no channel ready
 * to be used the function could return NULL. But you can also make
 * this function to add a new channel to the pool if no channel is
 * ready by using auto_inc as axl_true.
 *
 * The channel returned can be used for any operation, even closing
 * the channel. But, before issuing a close operation over a channel
 * which already belongs to a pool, this channel must be detached
 * first from the pool using \ref vortex_channel_pool_deattach.
 *
 * In general a close operation over channels belonging to a pool is
 * not recommended. In fact, the need to avoid channel closing
 * operations was the main reason to produce the channel pool module
 * because, as we have said, the channel close operation is too
 * expensive.
 * 
 * It's a better approach to let the vortex connection destruction
 * function to close all channels created for a pool.
 *
 * Another recommendation to keep in mind is the startup problem. Due
 * to the initial requirement to create new channels for the pool on
 * the first connection, it may slow down the startup (because it is
 * required to create several channels). A good approach is to create
 * a pool with one channel and use this function with the auto_inc set
 * always to axl_true.
 * 
 * This will enforce to create new channels only when needed reducing
 * the performance impact of creating an arbitrary number of channels
 * (inside the pool) at the startup.
 *
 * Once the channel was used, you should use \ref
