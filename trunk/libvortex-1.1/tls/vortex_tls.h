/**

 * 
 * Once a TLS negotiation is started two files are required to enable
 * TLS cyphering: the certificate and the private key. Two handlers
 * are used by the Vortex Library to allow user app level to configure
 * file locations for both files.
 * 
 * This handler is used to configure location for the certificate
 * file. The function will receive the connection where the TLS is
 * being request to be activated and the serverName value which hold a
 * optional host name value requesting to act as the server configured
 * by this value.
 * 
 * The function must return a path to the certificate using a
 * dynamically allocated value. Once finished, Vortex Library will
 * unref it.
 * 
 * <b>The function should return a basename file avoiding full path file
 * names</b>. This is because the Vortex Library will use \ref
 * vortex_support_find_data_file function to locate the file
 * provided. That function is configured to lookup on the configured
 * search path provided by \ref vortex_support_add_search_path or \ref
 * vortex_support_add_search_path_ref.
 * 
 * As a consequence: 
 * 
 * - If all certificate files are located at
 *  <b>/etc/repository/certificates</b> and the <b>serverName.cert</b> is to
 *   be used <b>DO NOT</b> return on this function <b>/etc/repository/certificates/serverName.cert</b>
 *
 * - Instead, configure <b>/etc/repository/certificates</b> at \ref
 *    vortex_support_add_search_path and return <b>servername.cert</b>.
 * 
 * - Doing previous practice will allow your code to be as
 *   platform/directory-structure independent as possible. The same
 *   function works on every installation, the only question to be
 *   configured are the search paths to lookup.
 *  
 * 
 * @param connection The connection where the TLS negotiation was
 * received.
 *
 * @param serverName An optional value requesting to act as the server
 * <b>serverName</b>. This value is supposed to be used to select the
 * right certificate file (according to the common value stored on

/**

 *
 * This handler is used by: 
 *  - \ref vortex_tls_set_ctx_creation
 *  - \ref vortex_tls_set_default_ctx_creation
 *
 * By default the Vortex TLS implementation will use its own code to
 * create the SSL_CTX object if not provided the handler. However,
 * such code is too general, so it is recomended to provide your own
 * context creation.
 *
 * Inside this function you must configure all your stuff to tweak the
 * OpenSSL behaviour. Here is an example:
 * 
 * \code
 * axlPointer * __ctx_creation (VortexConnection * conection,
 *                              axlPointer         user_data)
 * {
 *     SSL_CTX * ctx;
 *
 *     // create the context using the TLS method (for client side)
 *     ctx = SSL_CTX_new (TLSv1_method ());
 *
 *     // configure the root CA and its directory to perform verifications
 *     if (SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations (ctx, "your-ca-file.pem", "you-ca-directory")) {
 *         // failed to configure SSL_CTX context 
 *         SSL_CTX_free (ctx);
 *         return NULL;
 *     }
 *     if (SSL_CTX_set_default_verify_paths () != 1) {
 *         // failed to configure SSL_CTX context 
 *         SSL_CTX_free (ctx);
 *         return NULL;
 *     }
 *
 *     // configure the client certificate (public key)
 *     if (SSL_CTX_use_certificate_chain_file (ctx, "your-client-certificate.pem")) {
 *         // failed to configure SSL_CTX context 
 *         SSL_CTX_free (ctx);
 *         return NULL;
 *     }
 *
 *     // configure the client private key 
 *     if (SSL_CTX_use_PrivateKey_file (ctx, "your-client-private-key.rpm", SSL_FILETYPE_PEM)) {
 *         // failed to configure SSL_CTX context 
 *         SSL_CTX_free (ctx);
 *         return NULL;
 *     }
 *
 *     // set the verification level for the client side
 *     SSL_CTX_set_verify (ctx, SSL_VERIFY_PEER, NULL);
 *     SSL_CTX_set_verify_depth(ctx, 4);
 *
 *     // our ctx is configured
 *     return ctx;
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * For the server side, the previous example mostly works, but you
 * must reconfigure the call to SSL_CTX_set_verify, providing
 * something like this:
 * 
 * \code
 *    SSL_CTX_set_verify (ctx, SSL_VERIFY_PEER | SSL_VERIFY_FAIL_IF_NO_PEER_CERT, NULL);
 * \endcode
 *
 * See OpenSSL documenation for SSL_CTX_set_verify and SSL_CTX_set_verify_depth.
 * 
 * @param connection The connection that has been requested to be
 * activated the TLS profile, for which a new SSL_CTX must be created. 
 * 
 * @param user_data An optional user pointer defined at either \ref
 * vortex_tls_set_default_ctx_creation and \ref
 * vortex_tls_set_ctx_creation.
 * 
 * @return You must return a newly allocated SSL_CTX or NULL if the
 * handler must signal that the TLS activation must not be performed.
