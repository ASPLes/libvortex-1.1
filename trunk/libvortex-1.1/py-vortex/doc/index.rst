PyVortex's documentation center!
================================

PyVortex is a python binding for the Vortex Library 1.1, maintained
and supported by ASPL, that includes full support to write
client/listener BEEP applications written entirely in python.

Because quality matters, as with Vortex Library 1.1, PyVortex
development is being driven and checked with a regression test suite
to ensure each realease is ready for production environment.

PyVortex execution model for async notifications is really similar to
Vortex Library because the binding makes use of the GIL feature
described in: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0311/ This means
PyVortex library execution will still use threads but only one thread
at time will be executing inside the context of Python. 

Because PyVortex is a binding, Vortex Library 1.1 documention must be
used while using PyVortex: http://www.aspl.es/fact/files/af-arch/vortex-1.1/html/index.html
