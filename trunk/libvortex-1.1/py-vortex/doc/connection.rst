:mod:`vortex.Connection` --- PyVortexConnection class: BEEP session creation and management
===========================================================================================

.. currentmodule:: vortex


API documentation for vortex.Connection object representing a BEEP
session. vortex.Connection represents a single BEEP session which
holds a set of channels that are in charge of sending and receiving
useful user content, implement user authentication, and so on.

To create a connection, you need a context where to create it. See
vortex.Ctx documenation to know about it: :class:`vortex.Ctx`

A connection is created as follows::

   conn = vortex.Connection (ctx, "localhost", "602")
   if not conn.is_ok ():
       print ("ERROR: connection failed, error was: " + conn.error_msg)
       return

Note that after creating a connection, you must check if it is ok
using :meth:`vortex.Connection.is_ok` method.

Once a connection is created, you have to create channels to actually
send and receive data (and do any other useful work). This is done
using :class:`vortex.Channel`.

.. class:: Connection (ctx, host, port [, serverName])

   :param ctx: Vortex context where the connection will be created.
   :param type: vortex.Ctx

   :param host: Host to connect to.
   :type host: String

   :param port: Port to connect to.
   :type port: String

   :param serverName: Optional serverName value to ask for this channel. This value will change automatic behaviour notifying the provided serverName on next channel start request. 
   :type serverName: String

   .. method:: is_ok ()

      Allows to check if the current instance is properly connected  and available for operations.  This method is used to check  connection status after a failure.

      :rtype: True if the connection is ready, otherwise False is returned.

   .. method:: open_channel (number, profile, [frame_received], [frame_received_data], [encoding], [profile_content], [on_channel], [on_channel_data])
   
      Allows to create a new BEEP channel under the provided connection. The method receives two mandatory arguments channel number and profile.       

      :param number: Channel number requested to created. Channel number can be 0 (which makes PyVortex to select the next available for you).
      :type  number: Integer (> 0)

      :param profile: The channel profile to run.
      :type  profile: String

      :param frame_received: The handler to be configured on this channel to handle frame reception. 
      :type  frame_received: :ref:`frame-received-handler`.

      The following is an code example of a frame_received handler::

          def received_content (conn, channel, frame, data):
	      print ("Received frame, content: " + frame.payload)
	      return

      :param frame_received_data: User defined data to be passed to frame_received handler along with corresponding handler parameters.
      :type  frame_received_data: Object

      :param encoding: The type of encoding used for profile_content. This is optional and if not provided, encoding_NONE will be assumed. 
      :type  encoding: Integer. Valid values are vortex.encoding_NONE and vortex.encoding_BASE64

      :param profile_content: The profile channel start connect to be sent.
      :type  profile_content: String. Content codified as signaled by encoding param.

      :param on_channel: Optional handler that activates async channel create. If this handler is defined the method will return inmediately and channel creation will continue in background. Once finished the process (no matter the result) the channel will be notified on this handler (on_channel).
      :type  on_channel: :ref:`on-channel-handler`.

      :param on_channel_data: User defined data to be passed to on_channel handler along with corresponding handler parameters.
      :type  on_channel_data: Object

      :rtype: Returns a new reference to vortex.Channel or None if the method fails. 

      In the case of function failure you can use the following code to check for channel failure::

          if not channel:
	      print ("ERROR: failed to start channel, error found:")
	      err = conn.pop_channel_error ()
	      while err:
	          print ("ERROR: error code found: %d:%s" % (err[0], err[1]))

		  # next error found
		  err = conn.pop_channel_error ()

   .. method:: channel_pool_new (profile, init_num, [create_channel],[create_channel_data],[received],[received_data],[close],[close_data],[on_created],[user_data])

      :param user_data: User defined data to be passed to on_created handler along with corresponding handler parameters.
      :type  user_data: Object

      :return: Returns a new reference to vortex.ChannelPool or None if the on_created handler is defined.

   .. method:: pop_channel_error ()
   
      Allows to get the set of errors that happend on the connection instance. Each call to the method pops (and removes) the next error message tuple. Each tuple (Integer, String) contains an error code and an error string.

      :rtype: Returns the next tuple (Integer, String) or None if no error was found.

   .. method:: set_on_close (on_close, [on_close_data])
   
      Allows to configure a handler which will be called in the case the connection is closed. This is useful to detect broken pipe.

      :param on_close: The handler to be executed when the connection close is detected on the instance provided.
      :type  on_close: :ref:`on-close-handler`.

      :param on_close_data: The user defined data to be passed to the on_close handler along with handler corresponding parameters.
      :type  on_close_data: Object

      :return: Returns a new reference to a vortex.Handle that can be used to remove the on close handler configured using :meth:`remove_on_close`

   .. method:: remove_on_close (handle_ref)
   
      Allows to remove an on close handler configured using :meth:`set_on_close`. The close handler to remove is identified by the handle_ref parameter which is the value returned by the :meth:`set_on_close` handler.

      :param handle_ref: Reference to the on close handler to remove (value returned by :meth:`set_on_close`).
      :type  handl_ref: :class:`vortex.Handle`

      :return: True in the case the handler was found and removed, otherwise False is returned.

   .. method:: find_by_uri (profile)
   
      Allows to get the list of channels available (opened) on the connection which are running the provided profile.

      :param profile: Profile unique id used to select channels
      :type  profile: String

      :rtype: Returns a list of channels running the provided profile.

   .. method:: set_data (key, object)
   
      Allows to store arbitrary references associated to the connection. See also get_data.

      :param key: The key index to which the data gets associated.
      :type  key: String

      :param object: The object to store associated on the connection index by the given key.
      :type  object: Object

   .. method:: get_data (key)
   
      Allows to retreive a previously stored object using set_data

      :param key: The index for the object looked up
      :type  key: String

      :rtype: Returns the object stored or None if fails. 

   .. method:: pool ([pool_id])
   
      Allows to return a reference to the vortex.ChannelPool already created on the connection with the provided pool id.

      :param pool_id: Optional vortex.ChannelPool id. If no value is provided, channel pool id takes 1, which returns the default/first channel pool created.
      :type  pool_id: Integer (> 0)

      :rtype: Returns the vortex.ChannelPool associated or None if no channel pool exists with the provided id.

   .. method:: block ([block=True])
   
      Allows to block all incoming content on the provided connection by skiping connection available data state. This method binds vortex_connection_block C API.

      :param block: Optional boolean value that configure if the connection must be blocked (True) or unblocked (False). If not configured the connection is blocked (True).
      :type  block: Boolean (True if not configured)

   .. method:: is_blocked ()
   
      :rtype: Returns if the connection is blocked (due to :meth:`block`) or not.

   .. method:: close ()
   
      Allows to close the connection using full BEEP close negotation procotol. Keep in mind that using full BEEP close procedure may suffer from BNRA (see http://www.aspl.es/vortex/draft-brosnan-beep-limit-close.txt). It is recommended to use shutdown method.

      :rtype: Return True in the case the connection was close, otherwise False is returned (because some channel was denied to be closed by remote side).

   .. method:: shutdown ()
   
      Allows to close the connection by shutting down the transport layer supporting it. This causes the connection to be closed without taking place BEEP close negotiation. 

   .. method:: incref ()
   
      Allows to increment python reference count.  This is used in cases where the connection reference is automatically collected by python GC but the VortexConnection reference that it was representing is still working (and may receive notifications, like frame received). Note that a call to this method, requires a call to :meth:`decref`.

   .. method:: decref ()
   
      Allows to decrement python reference count.  See :meth:`incref` for more information.

   .. method:: skip_conn_close ([skip])
   
      Allows to configure this connection reference to not call to shutdown its associated reference when the python connection is collected. This method is really useful when it is required to keep working a connection that was created inside a function but that has finished.

      By default, any :class:`vortex.Connection` object created will be finished when its environment finishes. This means that when the function that created the connection finished, then the connection will be finished automatically.

      In many situations this is a desirable behaviour because your python application finishes automatically all the stuff opened. However, when the connection is created inside a handler or some method that implements connection startup but do not waits for the reply (asynchronous replies), then the connection must be still running until reply arrives. For these scenarios you have to use :meth:`skip_conn_close`.
