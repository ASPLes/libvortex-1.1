    Change Id: vortex-profile-mask-func-01
 Project name: Vortex Library 1.1
  Included in: already included and to be shipped with next stable
               release for 1.1 series
       Status: ACCEPTED
       Author: Francis Brosnan BlÃ¡zquez

Motivation
~~~~~~~~~~

To make Turbulence and other applications that configure a profile
mask function (VortexProfileMaskFunc) through
vortex_connection_set_profile_mask to return a more specific error
message, it is required to extend the handler definition
(VortexProfileMaskFunc) with a new parameter that allows the handler
implementor to optionally configure such error message.

This has as main target to allow personalization on the default
message actually returned if a profile is filtered:

 554 transaction failed: 
     requested profile is not available on the connection

Which do not represent an easy textual diagnostic error. For example,
Turbulence now returns the following if Profile Path denies the
profile:

 554 transaction failed: 
     server profile path configuration denies creating a
     channel with the profile requested.

Change Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To implement the change, a new parameter to the handler
VortexProfileMaskFunc is received: 

    char  ** error_msg

Which must be used by handler implementors to optionally return the
message to be used for the 554 error message.

The following symbols and functions gets affected by the change:

    - VortexProfileMaskFunc                 (handler)
    - vortex_connection_is_profile_filtered (function)

Solution to incompatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the first case, VortexProfileMaskFunc, the implementor must extend
its function definition, leaving it as is:

 bool   profile_mask (VortexConnection      * connection,
		      int                     channel_num,
		      const char            * uri,
		      const char            * profile_content,
		      const char            * serverName,
		      char                 ** error_msg,
		      axlPointer              user_data) {
      [..handler content..]

      if (channel_num > 0 && error_msg) {
            /* filter profile */
            (* error_msg) = axl_strdup ("Profile not accepted");
            return true;
      }

      [..more handler content..]
 }

In the case your application uses
vortex_connection_is_profile_filtered, you must add a new argument

   if (vortex_connection_is_profile_filtered (conn, 
                                              channel_num,
                                              uri, 
                                              profile_content,
                                              serverName, 
        /* new parameter, it could be NULL */ error_msg)) {
        [..error handling..]  
   }
