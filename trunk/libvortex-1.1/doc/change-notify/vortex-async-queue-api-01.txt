    Change Id: vortex-async-queue-api-01
 Project name: Vortex Library
  Included in: already included and to be shipped with next stable
               release 1.0.3
       Status: NOTIFY
       Author: Francis Brosnan Bl√°zquez

Motivation
~~~~~~~~~~

Due to the ongoing work to remove the GLib dependency, previous
releases were using the GAsyncQueue as a way to communicate several
threads and as synchronization mechanism. This has been replaced with
VortexAsyncQueue type.

Change Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any function returning or receiving a (GAsyncQueue *) type now does
exactly the same function but based on VortexAsyncQueue. There is a
perfect match between the space of functions defined by
g_async_queue_* to vortex_async_queue_*, with one exception:
g_async_queue_timed_pop.

For all functions that have been updated, are now included a brief
example of code showing how to use the list. 

The following is only one function from the public API that has been
updated:

  - vortex_channel_get_reply

Solution to incompatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You have to do two replace operations:

  - "GAsyncQueue" by "VortexAsyncQueue"
  - "g_async_queue" by "vortex_async_queue"

There is only one exception:

  - "g_async_queue_timed_pop" is replaced by "vortex_async_queue_timedpop"
