    Change Id: vortex-notify-start-01
 Project name: Vortex Library
  Included in: already included and to be shipped with next stable release
               1.1.1
       Status: NOTIFY
       Author: Francis Brosnan Bl√°zquez

Motivation
~~~~~~~~~~

Current definition of VortexOnChannelCreated do not provide a
reference to the connection under which the channel start request was
issued.

Because the channel reference provided on that function is NULL if
channel start fails, the only way to get errors found is to call to
vortex_connection_pop_channel_error. However, it is required a
reference to the connection under which the channel start took place.

This change notification modifies the VortexOnChannelCreated handler
definition to include a reference to the connection used.

Change Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New definition includes a reference to the connection where the
channel start was issued as follows:

typedef void (* VortexOnChannelCreated) (int                channel_num, 
                                         VortexChannel    * channel, 
					 VortexConnection * conn,
					 axlPointer         user_data);


Solution to incompatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This change notification creates an API and binary incompatibility for
those users creating channels in an async manner, using
VortexOnChannelCreated handler.

If your code create channels using NULL for the last two parameters
of:

  - vortex_channel_new
  - vortex_channel_new_full
  - vortex_channel_new_fullv

..then the change have no effect for you. Otherwise, an update for the
handler receiving the channel start reply must be updated as indicated
previously.
