Release note
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Advanced Software Production Line is proud to announce the Vortex
  Library 0.8.5 availability: an open source "BEEP Core" protocol
  implementation written in C and mapped into TCP/IP.

  Vortex Library is a powerful toolkit to write new application
  protocols and application over the well-defined "BEEP Core" protocol
  defined at RFC3080/RFC3081. 

  Vortex Library has been developed inside the Af-Arch project as its
  data transport layer. 

  Vortex Library is a really stable and robust application protocol
  development toolkit. Currently it is running under Microsoft Windows
  and GNU/Linux platforms.

  Check out the following links to get ready with Vortex Library:

    - http://www.sf.net/projects/vortexlibrary - download site.

    - http://fact.aspl.es - Af-Arch homepage where Vortex Library is
      being developed.

      section. Inside this section, Vortex Library documentation can be
      found. 

Changes
~~~~~~~

  Improved memory used by Vortex Library:

  * making vortex_exit function to be reentrant (several threads can actually
  execute this function at the same time).

  * making xmlValidDtd to use a stack activated xmlValidCtxt value rather than
  a heap allocated xmlValidCtxtPtr.

  * making vortex_exit function to release resources allocated for its normal
  function before exiting: freeing vortex sequencer buffers, freeing vortex
  dtds and cleaning xml library.

  * fixing several memory leaks on vortex_connection, vortex_channel and vortex
  dtd modules caused by improper call to xmlParseMemory [libxml2].

  * fixing memory leak on vortex_frame_factory module caused by not freeing 
  allocated raw frame to be console outputed.

  * adding a new function vortex_log_is_enabled to check when is vortex log
  to console activated.

  * making vortex_init function to call to libxml initialization and making
  vortex_dtds module to be initialized only one time. Adding calls to
  vortex_dtds_cleanups and xmlCleanupParser.

  * fixing memory leak on vortex_frame_free function caused by not calling
  g_free on content_type attribute.
 
  * making vortex_connection_close more efficient. Connection close
  for sessions have 0, 1 or n channels are managed in a particular
  way.
