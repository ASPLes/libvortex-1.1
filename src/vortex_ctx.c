/** 
 * @brief Creates a new vortex execution context. This is mainly used
 * by the main module (called from \ref vortex_init_ctx) and finished from
 * \ref vortex_exit_ctx. 
 *
 * A context is required to make vortex library to work. This object
 * stores a single execution context. Several execution context can be
 * created inside the same process.
 *
 * After calling to this function, a new \ref VortexCtx is created and
 * all configuration required previous to \ref vortex_init_ctx can be
 * done. Once prepared, a call to \ref vortex_init_ctx starts vortex
 * library.
 *
 * Once you want to stop the library execution you must call to \ref
 * vortex_exit_ctx.
 *
 * See http://lists.aspl.es/pipermail/vortex/2008-January/000343.html

 *
 * @return A newly allocated reference to the \ref VortexCtx. You must
 * finish it with \ref vortex_ctx_free.
